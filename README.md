I am hacking on little Angular JS apps within this Ghost theme.  This them is based on the default 'Casper' theme that comes with ghost.

The goal is to create Anuglar apps that you can include on any ghost post.  The apps are totally contained within the theme directory, including HTML templates and JS files for each app you create.

The JS files must have the same name as the post in Ghost.

To use it, copy it into you themes directory.
